## Getting Involved

Writing patches is not the only way to get involved with the development of Leaflet. You can help the project tremendously by discovering and reporting bugs, improving documentation, helping others on the [Leaflet forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leaflet-js) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues), and spreading the word about Leaflet among your colleagues and friends.
